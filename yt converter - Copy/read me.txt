this project was developed in python

its just a project that i've started to develop my skills as a developer and not
steal or harm any property or person.

i started this project the 1st of september and just created an app using a command line that is able the take a url and
download the video and created a script that when u give it a link for a playlist it relives the links of the diffrent
videos in it and stores them into a file called linkslist.txt then it can be used by the downloader script to download all
the videos in the file

what i need to do next is:
download the files into another location
make the app update over the internet
create a graphical interface
